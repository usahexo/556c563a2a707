#  LeoVegas Goes All In OnVirtual Sports Betting

The operator has announced a new partnership with Inspired, which will see it launch a portfolio of virtual sports products.

LeoVegas has announced that it is partnering up with Inspired to launch a new range of virtual sports products. The move comes as the operator looks to capitalise on the growing popularity of virtual sports betting, and follows its recent deal with SG Digital.

Virtual sports are simulations of real-life sporting events, which allow bettors to place wagers on things such as who will win or how many goals will be scored. The products have proven popular in recent years, thanks in part to their fast-paced and exciting nature.

Commenting on the partnership, LeoVegas spokesperson David Clash said: "We are really excited about this partnership with Inspired. Their portfolio of virtual sports products is among the best in the industry and we are confident that our players will love them."

Clash went on to say that LeoVegas is committed to offering its customers the "widest possible range" of betting options, and that the new virtual sports products will play a key role in achieving this goal.

Inspired CEO Matt Davey added: "LeoVegas is one of the most well-recognised names in iGaming and we are thrilled to be working with them. They have an excellent track record in terms of player experience and we look forward to combining our strengths to deliver an outstanding offering."

The new virtual sports products will be available at LeoVegas from early 2019.

#  LeoVegas Starts Offering Virtual Sports Betting

The popular online casino LeoVegas has started offering virtual sports betting, giving its customers the opportunity to place bets on simulated sporting events.

Virtual sports have been around for a few years now, but they have really taken off in recent times. This is largely due to the fact that they offer a more realistic experience than traditional slot games or table games, and this has helped them to become one of the most popular types of online gambling.

LeoVegas has been quick to recognise the potential of virtual sports, and it has now become one of the first major online casinos to offer them. This means that its customers will be able to place bets on events such as horse racing, motor racing and football, all from the comfort of their own homes.

There are already a number of different virtual sports providers out there, but LeoVegas is confident that it can offer something that is unique and appealing to its customers. The company is promising an experience that is both immersive and exciting, with plenty of betting options available on each event.

Virtual sports are ideal for those who want an occasional flutter on a sporting event, without having to worry about actually following the sport itself. They are also perfect for those who want to bet on events that are taking place in other parts of the world, as all of the action is taking place in a virtual world.

LeoVegas has plans to expand its virtual sports offering even further in the near future, so keep an eye out for some new and exciting additions to the lineup. In the meantime, be sure to check out some of the amazing virtual sports events that are currently available at LeoVegas!

Virtual sports are popular with customers because they provide a quick and easy way to bet on a wide range of sporting events. There is no need to wait for hours for a live event to start - you can place bets on virtual events any time you like.
