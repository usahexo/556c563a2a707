#  Dear Francis Ford Coppola: Here's How to Add Roulette to Twitch

Hey Francis Ford Coppola,

Adding roulette to Twitch would be a great way to increase viewership on your channel. In this article, we'll show you how to do it.

First, you'll need to create a new room in OBS. Name it "Roulette."

Next, add the following source:

https://www.twitch.tv/api/broadcast/room?name=Roulette&channel=yourname&client_id=x

Replace "yourname" with your actual Twitch username, and replace "x" with your client ID. You can find your client ID by going to https://www.twitch.tv/settings and clicking on the "Connections" tab. The client ID will be listed next to "Client ID."

Now, open the Roulette room in OBS and drag the "Twitch Viewers" window onto the main screen. This window will show how many viewers are watching your stream at any given time.

To start the roulette game, type "/roulette start" into the chat box. To stop the game, type "/roulette stop."
