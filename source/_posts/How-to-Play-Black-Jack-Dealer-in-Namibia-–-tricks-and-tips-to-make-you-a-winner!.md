#  How to Win at Black Jack Dealer – some great advice for improving your game!

When it comes to gambling, Black Jack is one of the most popular games played in casinos all over the world. The game is simple to understand, but difficult to master which is why so many people are drawn to it. There are a few basic rules that you need to follow in order to increase your chances of winning, and by following these tips you can become a Black Jack Dealer expert in no time!

The first thing you need to do is familiarize yourself with the different types of Black Jack hands. There are ten in total, and they are as follows: two pair, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush, royal flush and blackjack. In order to win at Black Jack Dealer, you need to have a hand that beats the dealer’s hand. This means that your hand must be higher than his or her hand, or equal if both hands are of the same rank.

One of the simplest ways to improve your chances of winning at Black Jack Dealer is by using basic strategy. Basic strategy is a mathematical approach to gambling which tells you the best plays to make based on the cards you are dealt. It takes into account the fact that the house edge can be reduced by making certain plays rather than others. You can find basic strategy charts online which will show you exactly what moves to make in any given situation.

Another great tip for winning at Black Jack Dealer is to always split Aces and 8s. When you are dealt an Ace and an 8, splitting them gives you two separate hands which both have potential for winning. If you were to keep them together as one hand, your chances of winning would be much lower. Splitting also allows you to bet more money on each hand which increases your chances of winning overall.

In addition to using basic strategy and splitting Aces and 8s, another way to give yourself an edge when playing Black Jack Dealer is by counting cards. Card counting is a technique that allows players to keep track of the high and low cards which have been played thus far in the game. By doing this, players can estimate how likely it is that the next card will be a high or low card which will help them decide whether or not they should place a bet. While card counting does take some practice, it can be a very effective way of increasing your odds of winning at Black Jack Dealer.

#  How to Play Black Jack like a Pro – dealer Namibia style!

Black Jack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. Played with a deck of 52 cards, the aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over. In this article, we will teach you how to play Black Jack like a professional – dealer Namibia style!

# The Basics:

The game begins with each player being dealt two cards face-down. The dealer also deals themselves two cards, but one of these is face-up. Players then take it in turns to decide whether they would like to ‘hit’ (take another card) or stay (stick with their current total). The aim is to reach a total of 21, or as close to it as possible. Cards valued at 10 or less are counted as their face value, whilst cards valued at 11 or above are counted as 1 and 0 respectively (e.g. an Ace is counted as 1 and a 6 is counted as 6). If your total goes over 21, you ‘bust’ and lose the hand.

The player with the highest total at the end of the hand wins. In the event of a tie (e.g. both players have totals of 21), the hand is considered a draw and no money is exchanged between players.

In Black Jack, there are two types of bet that can be placed – a regular bet and an insurance bet. A regular bet is simply made by betting on whether you think you will beat the dealer or not. An insurance bet, on the other hand, is made when the dealer has an Ace showing as their upcard. In this instance, you can choose to place a bet that the dealer will bust (go over 21). If they do bust, your insurance bet pays out 2:1; if they don’t bust however, your insurance bet loses just like any other bet would!

Now that you know the basics, let’s take a look at some tips for playing Black Jack like a pro!

# The following tips are based on standard six-deck blackjack:





  ## Strategy 1: Keep track of totals

   If you keep track of which cards have been played already, it will give you a better idea about which cards are still remaining in the deck(s). This information can help you make more informed decisions when it comes to hitting and standing. For example: if there are only low cards remaining in the deck, it might be wise to hit even if your current total is 16 – there’s a good chance that you’ll get closer to 21 this way!

   ## Strategy 2: Split pairs whenever possible

   When you are dealt two identical cards (e.g. two Kings), you can choose to split them into two separate hands (by placing another bet equal to your first bet). This increases your chances of winning since you now have two chances instead of one! Note that some casinos only allow players to split pairs once – so be sure to check before playing.

   ## Strategy 3: Double down on 11

  Doubling down means increasing your original bet by 100% - so if you place a $10 bet, doubling down will see you wager an additional $10. When you double down ,you must take another card and stand thereafter .The rationale behind doubling down on 11 is that it gives players excellent odds of winning - especially when compared against standing or hitting .

#  Winning Tips for Playing Black Jack Dealer – uncover the secrets of the pros!

There are a few secrets that the pros use to help them win in black jack. Dealer can use these secrets to help him or her win as well.

The first secret is to know when to hit and when to stand. This takes some practice, but it is important to know what your odds are for each decision. If you hit when you should stand, you will likely lose the hand. Conversely, if you stand when you should hit, you could end up with a higher hand and increase your chance of winning.

Another secret to winning is to never split 10s or Aces. If you have a 10, it is best to keep it as is instead of splitting it into two hands. The same goes for Aces – splitting them makes them weaker hands and gives the dealer a better chance of winning.

Thirdly, try to avoid doubling down unless you have a very good hand. Doubling down means that you are doubling your bet and only getting one more card. This can be risky, so it is best to only do it if you have a very good hand such as an 11 or 12.

Finally, always remember to take insurance if the dealer has an Ace up. This can help protect your bets in case the dealer does get a black jack.
