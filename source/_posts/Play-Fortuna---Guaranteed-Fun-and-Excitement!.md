It is a game of skill and chance, and there is plenty of money to be won. If you are looking to make some extra cash, why not try your luck at poker?

There are many different poker variants, but the most popular is Texas Hold'em. In Texas Hold'em, each player is dealt two cards face down, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. The player can use any combination of their two cards and the community cards to make the best hand possible. The aim of the game is to beat the other players by making the best hand possible.

The first step is to bet. Each player must put in an ante, and then they can bet or raise as much as they like. The second step is the flop. The flop consists of three community cards that are turned over at once. The third stage is the turn, which is another community card that is turned over. The fourth stage is the river, which is the last community card that is turned over. The fifth and final stage is showdown, where each player shows their hand and the winner is determined.

Texas Hold'em can be a very challenging game, but it can also be very rewarding. If you are willing to learn the basics and practice regularly, you can become a winning poker player in no time!

## The Basics of Poker
Poker is a card game where players are each dealt five cards face down. In addition, there is a communal card pool that all players can use which is turned over one card at a time. The aim of the game is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of your own cards and those on the table. The player who makes the best hand wins the pot.

There are many different variants of poker, but we'll focus on Texas Hold'em in this guide as it's one of the most popular versions of the game. In Texas Hold'em, each player is dealt two concealed cards (hole cards), after which there is a round of betting. Then three community cards are turned over (the flop), followed by another round of betting. A fourth community card (the turn) is then revealed and another round of betting takes place before the final community card (the river) is shown. At this point, all players who haven't folded reveal their hands and whoever has the best hand wins.

In order to calculate your hand ranking in Texas Hold'em, simply refer to this handy chart:
