#  How do FC Barcelona casino dealers keep their cards so well shuffled?

Casino dealers have a difficult job. They must keep the game moving while ensuring that all players have a fair chance of winning. One way they keep the game moving is by quickly shuffling the cards. This is done by using a technique known as a “false shuffle.”

A false shuffle is when the dealer appears to shuffle the cards, but actually does not randomize them at all. This can be done in a number of ways, but one popular technique is called the “Brazilian shuffle.”

In the Brazilian shuffle, the dealer holds the deck in one hand and pulls out a few cards with the other hand. The dealer then repeats this process several times, until there are only a few cards left in the original hand. These remaining cards are then quickly dropped on top of the deck in their original order.

This appears to be a fair shuffle, but in reality, it’s not. By keeping track of which cards are pulled out and which ones are dropped on top, the dealer can ensure that specific cards stay together. This allows them to quickly deal out specific hands to players, or even place certain cards into different hands during play.

So how do casino dealers keep track of all these cards? One way is by using a technique called “card counting.” Card counting involves keeping track of how many high and low value cards have been played, so that the dealer can predict which cards are likely to come up next.
