#  Malta to Regulate On-Line Casino BetGamesTV

On Wednesday, the Maltese government announced that it would be regulating on-line casino BetGamesTV. The new regulations will require operators of such platforms to obtain a license from the Malta Gaming Authority as well as adhering to specific rules and requirements.

The impetus for this regulatory change is to protect players located in Malta as well as to ensure that the industry remains fair and transparent. Among the rules that will be put into place are those that mandate responsible gambling measures, like age verification and spending caps.

Additionally, operators of BetGamesTV platforms will be required to contribute a percentage of their profits to a charity or social cause related to gambling addiction prevention. This requirement is meant to offset any potential social costs associated with problem gambling.

Justice Minister Owen Bonnici commented on the announcement, saying that it represented an important step forward in ensuring responsible gaming in Malta. He also thanked the Malta Gaming Authority for working with the government on crafting these new regulations.

Malta is not alone in its efforts to regulate on-line casino BetGamesTV platforms; other countries, including the UK and Sweden, have implemented similar measures in order to protect their citizens.

Gibraltar has long been a leading center for online gambling and it is one of the few jurisdictions that have developed a comprehensive regulatory framework for the industry. The GBGA was founded in 2004 and its members include some of the biggest names in online gambling.

The new licensing regime will allow BetGamesTV to offer its services to customers in Gibraltar and other EU countries. The company will be required to adhere to strict regulatory standards, including controls on customer protection, responsible gaming, and safeguarding against financial crime.

BetGamesTV is a Malta-based company that offers a range of gambling services, including casino games, sports betting, and virtual sports. It has been active in the market since 2013 and has developed a reputation for providing high quality products and services.

Commenting on the news, CEO of BetGamesTV Gaetan Verbeeck said: "This is an important milestone for BetGamesTV as we continue our expansion into new markets. The GBGA has rigorous standards and we are committed to meeting all of their requirements."

Online gambling is one of the fastest growing sectors in the global gaming industry and Gibraltar is well positioned to take advantage of this growth. The new licensing regime will ensure that companies like BetGamesTV are operating in a safe and secure environment, which is essential for attracting customers in today's competitive marketplace.
