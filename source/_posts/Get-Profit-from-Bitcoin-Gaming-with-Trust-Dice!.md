#  Profit from Bitcoin Gaming with the Help of Trust Dice

Bitcoin gaming is a great way to earn some extra income. Not only do you get to enjoy the excitement of playing your favorite games, but you can also profit from it. In this article, we are going to talk about how you can use Trust Dice to make money from Bitcoin gaming.

What is Trust Dice?

Trust Dice is a dice gambling game that allows users to bet their Bitcoin on the outcome of a roll. The game is based on the popular dice game called Craps. Trust Dice offers a provably fair betting system, which allows users to verify that the results of each roll are fair and unbiased.

How to Play Trust Dice

To play Trust Dice, you first need to deposit Bitcoin into your Trust Dice account. Once the funds have been deposited, you can start betting on the outcome of each roll. The minimum bet amount is 0.00001 BTC, and the maximum bet amount is 100 BTC.

There are two ways that you can bet on the outcome of a roll: You can either bet on the “roll” or the “point”. To bet on the “roll”, you need to predict whether the result of the next roll will be higher or lower than the current number shown on the dice. To bet on the “point”, you need to predict whether the next roll will be a 7 or an 11 (the point number in Craps).

If your prediction is correct, you will win x2 your bet amount. If your prediction is incorrect, you will lose your entire bet amount. There is also a 1% house edge for Trust Dice, so make sure that you keep that in mind when betting.
