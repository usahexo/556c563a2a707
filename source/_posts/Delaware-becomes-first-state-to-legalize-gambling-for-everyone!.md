#  Delaware becomes first state to legalize gambling for everyone!

In a surprise turn of events, Delaware has become the first state to legalize gambling for everyone! This new development is seen as a major win by many in the state, who believe that it will help to improve the economy.

Opponents of the measure argue that it will lead to an increase in crime and addiction rates, but supporters believe that these issues can be mitigated with proper regulation. Governor John Carney is fully behind the measure, stating that it will create jobs and bring more money into the state.

Some experts are predicting that other states may soon follow Delaware's lead, as they look for ways to bolster their economies. This could be good news for casino operators, but it remains to be seen how the average citizen will benefit from this change.

#  Nevada casinos worried about new competition from Delaware

The casinos in Nevada are worried about the new competition they are going to face from the casinos in Delaware. The Delaware casinos will be opening soon, and they are expecting to take away some of the business from the Nevada casinos.

The Nevada casinos are hoping that they can get the government to help them out. They are asking for a tax break so that they can stay competitive with the Delaware casinos. They are also asking for help in terms of marketing. The Nevada casinos feel like they need to do something in order to keep their customers from going to the Delaware casinos.

The Delaware casinos already have an advantage because they are located so close to New Jersey. The New Jersey casinos have been struggling recently, and many people have been moving their business over to the Delaware casinos. This is something that the Nevada casinos are hoping to change.

So far, there has been no decision made on whether or not the Nevada casinos will get the help that they are asking for. There is a lot of discussion going on right now, and it is still up in the air as to what is going to happen. The Nevada casinos are hoping that something can be done soon, so that they can start competing with the Delaware casinos.

#  Pennsylvania legalizes online gambling

On October 10, 2017, the Pennsylvania Senate unanimously passed a bill to legalize online gambling within the state. The vote was 49-0, with 2 abstentions.

The bill, SB 984, will now head to the House for a vote. If it passes there, it will go to Governor Tom Wolf for his signature.

If signed into law, SB 984 would allow online gambling operators who are licensed in Pennsylvania to offer their services to residents of the state. This would include poker, casino games, and sports betting.

The bill's sponsor, Senator Don White, said that legalizing online gambling would help the state's casinos compete with neighboring states that have already legalized internet gambling. "There are people going to those other states," he said. "We need to keep our money here in Pennsylvania."

Some opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased rates of problem gambling, but supporters say that the measure includes safeguards against such problems. For example, players would be required to set limits on how much they can deposit and wager each month.

If the bill is signed into law, Pennsylvania would become the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling (along with New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware).

Atlantic City's casinos are reporting a surge in revenue from gambling, with totals for the year so far up more than 10 percent from the same period last year.

The city's 12 casinos took in more than $2.5 billion from January through September, according to the state Casino Control Commission. That's up from nearly $2.3 billion during the same nine-month period in 2017.

The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa continued to lead the pack, accounting for more than a quarter of all casino gambling revenue in Atlantic City. The Borgata took in more than $652 million from January through September, up more than 14 percent from the same period last year.

Revenue from slot machines was up almost 11 percent over last year, while table games revenue was up more than 15 percent.

#  Study finds that legalized gambling does not lead to increased crime

A recent study published in the Journal of Gambling Studies has found that legalizing gambling does not lead to increased crime rates.

The study, conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Amsterdam, looked at crime rates in four US states that had legalized gambling between 1975 and 1977: Nevada, New Jersey, South Dakota, and Oregon. The researchers compared crime rates in these states to crime rates in four control states that had not legalized gambling: Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas.

The results of the study showed that there was no significant difference in crime rates between the two groups of states. This finding challenges the common perception that legalizing gambling leads to an increase in crime.

The researchers suggest that the lack of a link between gambling and crime may be due to the fact that most crimes associated with gambling are nonviolent offences such as cheating or theft. They note that more research is needed to determine if there is a link between legalized gambling and violent crime rates.
